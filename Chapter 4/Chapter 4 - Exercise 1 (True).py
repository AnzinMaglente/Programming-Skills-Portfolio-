Chapter 4 - Exercise 1: Alien Colors #1
Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 
'yellow', or 'red'.

•Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it is, print a message that the player just earned 
5 points.

•Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails. (The version that fails will have no 
output.)

alien_color = "green"

if alien_color == "green": #This checks if the alien is color green if true it will print out the following message
    print("You earned 5 points")

#The condition is true, which returns "You earned 5 points
