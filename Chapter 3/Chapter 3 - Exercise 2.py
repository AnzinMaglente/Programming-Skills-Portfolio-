Chapter 3 - Exercise 2: Greetings
Start with the list you used in Exercise 1, but instead of just printing each person’s name, 
print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should 
be personalized with the person’s name.

my_friends = ["Cid", "James", "Ericka", "Lianne", "Carl"]

print ("Hello, how are you today " + my_friends[0] + "?")
print ("What's your favorite clothes brand " + my_friends[1] + "?")
print ("Wow, if you like that. Then do you like bowling? " + my_friends[2])
print ("Yoo " + my_friends[3] + "! have you watched the new series?")
print (my_friends[4] + " You like coding right? What language do you mainly use?")
